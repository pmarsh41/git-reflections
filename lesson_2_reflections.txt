# What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing a repo creates a repo that tracks the metadata for all files inside. 'git init' must be run to for version control within the folder.

# How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is comprised of files that are being committed. Multiple files can be in staging.

# How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
git add can be used to place commits in the staging area one at a time

#What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches help when you have two different version of a file that you want to make commits to. 

#How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

The diagrams help me visualize the parent relationships of each commit and which ones might be unreachable. 

#What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
Merging branches together creates one branch with all of the reachable changes from each. Its represented in the diagram so the relationships are more apparent.
