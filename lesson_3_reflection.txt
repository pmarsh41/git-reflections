When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I'd want to use a remote repo when I'm going to share an open source project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may not want to have your remote repo synched with other branches you’re working on. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is when you copy the contents of someone else repo to yours on Github. Clone is when copy the repo locally. Branch is when you create another version of a repo locally. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Having the last known copy locally allows for a better git merge process when incorporating changes that may have happened when offline. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I don’t know how I would collaborate with anyone for web development without Github. I guess I would try .txt files on Google Drive or something. Again, hard to imagine doing this on something other than GitHub. It would be impossible to track pull requests, fork, etc, without it.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
